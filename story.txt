Once upon a time in a land of magic, there existed a bookworm named Borl.
Most bookworms lived peaceful and very uneventful lives but not Boral. He 
lived in a magical library. Being a bookworm, Boral only knew of one aspect of
the library's magic. The books in the library transported the reader into a 
different realm; a realm in which the books plot carried out. Bookworms ate 
books, not read them, but eating them proved to be just as effective. 
Whenever he ate a book, Boral went on an adventure.
